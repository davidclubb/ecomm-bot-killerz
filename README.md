Well look no further... Welcome to ecomm-bot-killerz. We specialize in detecting the use of bots and using coutermeasures to thrawrt these meanaces from making any purchases.

When I think of these types of script kiddies, I think about professional sports athletes. Men and women at the top of their game. These individuals are in peak physical and mental shape. But they have caught this bug...it is called GREED. They have also contracted the need to be better than anyone else who has come before them, no matter who they hurt, who they have to step on and whatever the damage to themselves they inflict. Much like the professional athlete who starts taking steroids to be justs a little better, just a little faster, hit the ball a little further or jump a little higher their good intentions have turned into this monster. They actually beileves they will not get caught or be stopped. They believe that just a little bit will not hurt. Except it does hurt. It hurts the sport, the record books and so much more. These individuals can hurt your sales, can hurt your image and can extort money from collectors and consumers alike for their own personal gain.

Well ladies and gentleman, we plan on doing something about that. We plan on methodically identifying when the use of a bot is happening to your ecommerce website, we plan to categoricaly identify what the bot is attempting to do and where the bot originated from, and we plan to systematically prevent the bot from completing that purchase and preventing that bot and the script kiddie that created it from using any bot against your precious site ever again.

Whenever you find us and ask for our help, we will be right here, fighting the good fight against script kiddies.
